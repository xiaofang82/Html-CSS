# Html-CSS

## This is my first team assignment in MITT.

### This project is a travel company website that built using HTML and CSS language. The team member is Zhixin, Xiaofang(me) and Tieyao.

#### My instructor Andre has certain requirements for the overall layout and color scheme of the website. We researched a lot of websites which are modern and fashionable. At the beginning we wanted build a website for information technology company, but after our discussion and experimentation, we ultimately chose a travel company website that can give us more space to design.
#### Firstly, we unanimously decided to use blue as the color scheme, which is in line with our positioning for the website design. Tourism is like flying freely in the sky like a bird, and swimming in the sea like a fish.
